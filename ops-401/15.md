Web Application Threat Modeling with OWASP, DREAD
-----------
_10/26/2020_

> Threat modeling: the sooner the better, but never too late.

Most bugs are put into production through Development. OWASP recommends to bring Security and Development teams together to collaborate on a shared understanding to identify threats, compliance requirements, and evaluate risk
to build required controls.

#### Threat Modeling Considerations

1. What are we building?
    - Architecture diagrams
        - Do we need it?
    - Dataflow transitions
    - Data classifications
2. What can go wrong?
    - STRIDE 
    - Kill Chains 
    - CAPEC
3. What are we going to do about that?
    - Contextualise the risk
    - Weight risk vs value
    - Agreement & Tagging
    - Fix Implementation
4. Did we do a good enough job?
    - Retrospective 
        - Check quality, feasibility, progress
        - Test Test Test 


### DREAD

DREAD is an acronym for risk assessment. It was created at Microsoft and is a standard for [OpenStack](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/OSSA-Metrics#DREAD).

DREAD scores five categories, which are summed and divided by five, the result is a score from 0-10

- ***0 indicates no impact***
- ***10 is the worst possible outcome***

The categories are:

- `Damage` – how bad would an attack be?
- `Reproducibility` – how easy is it to reproduce the attack?
- `Exploitability` – how much work is it to launch the attack?
- `Affected users` – how many people will be impacted?
- `Discoverability` – how easy is it to discover the threat?
