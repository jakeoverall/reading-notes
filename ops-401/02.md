  <summary>What are the first 5 Steps to establish a SOC?</summary>  

1. **The Soc != IT**
  - The SOC protects an entire organization from security breaches. They are not help desk for internal employees or external customers. *Creates the VPN / Doesn't help you connect to it*
2. **Provide Tooling and Training**
  - Without the appropriate tools and training a SOC is only an illusion of safety.
3. **Vet and Hire**
  - Security analysts and security engineers are supervised by an SOC manager. The SOC manager needs to have strong security expertise, management skills, and battle-tested crisis management experience.
4. **Have an incident response plan ready**
  - It is not a question of if you will be attacked but rather when you will be attacked. Have a plan in place and ready to be executed.
5. **Defend**
  - Every point of entry or communcation between machines is a potential vulnerability. Never trust the client and assume every request is malicious.

  <summary>Name 3 best practices for a SOC?</summary>  

1. **Detect threats through all stages of an attack**
  - All attacks have three stages Pre-Attack, Attack, Post-Attack. All stages are equally important but only one can be addressed before an issue exists.
2. **Investigate all alerts to ensure nothing is overlooked**
  - "It always does that" is not a good excuse to allow a problem to persist.
3. **Gather forensic evidence for investigation and remediation**
  - AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert), then Red, Green, Refactor.
