  <summary>What is the difference between SOC and a CSIRT?</summary>
  <blockquote>The SOC protects the company from security breaches by identifying, analyzing and reacting to cybersecurity threats. The core function of a CSIRT is to minimize and manage damage caused by an incident, the CSIRT also communicates with stakeholders. The SOC often oversees the CSIRT

    <li><b>SOC:</b><em> DETECTION</em> - Security Operations Center</li>
    <li><b>CSIRT:</b><em> RESPONSE</em> - Computer Security Incident Response Team</li>

  <summary>What are the first 5 Steps to establish a SOC?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The Soc != IT</b>
      <p>The SOC protects an entire organization from security breaches. They are not help desk for internal employees or external customers. Creates the VPN / Doesn't help you connect to it
      </p><p>
    </li>
    </p></li><li><b>Provide Tooling and Training</b>
      <p>Without the appropriate tools and training a SOC is only an illusion of safety.
      </p><p>
    </li>
    </p></li><li><b>Vet and Hire</b>
      <p>Security analysts and security engineers are supervised by an SOC manager. The SOC manager needs to have strong security expertise, management skills, and battle-tested crisis management experience.
      </p><p>
    </li>
    </p></li><li><b>Have an incident response plan ready</b>
      <p>It is not a question of if you will be attacked but rather when you will be attacked. Have a plan in place and ready to be executed.
      </p><p>
    </li>
    </p></li><li><b>Defend</b>
      <p>Every point of entry or communcation between machines is a potential vulnerability. Never trust the client and assume every request is malicious.
      </p><p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <summary>Name 3 best practices for a SOC?</summary>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Detect threats through all stages of an attack</b>
      <p>All attacks have three stages Pre-Attack, Attack, Post-Attack. All stages are equally important but only one can be addressed before an issue exists.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Investigate all alerts to ensure nothing is overlooked</b>
      <p>"It always does that" is not a good excuse to allow a problem to persist.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Gather forensic evidence for investigation and remediation</b>
      <p>AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert), then Red, Green, Refactor.
      </p>
    </li>
