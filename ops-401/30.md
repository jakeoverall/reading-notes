Mimikatz (*French for cute cat*) is a post-exploitation tool designed to help attackers extract information from target systems. Mimikatz is an open-source application that allows users to view and save authentication credentials. Mimikatz can do a lot, and its modular structure means that new features and functions can be added to the platform with relative ease.

A Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack is a technique whereby an attacker captures a password hash (as opposed to the password characters) and then simply passes it through for authentication and potentially lateral access to other networked systems.
