Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
-----------
_10/16/2020_

> Intrusion detection systems are a lot like fire alarms. Just as a fire alarm detects smoke, an intrusion detection system idenitifies incidents and potential threats.

**An IDS** is a visibility tool that sits off to the side of the network and monitors traffic. It consists of a management console and sensors. When the sensors encounter something that matches up to a previously detected attack signature, they report the activity to the console. An IDS can notify security personnel of infections, spyware or key loggers, as well as accidental information leakage, security policy violations, unauthorized clients and servers, and even configuration errors

---

**An IPS** is similar to an IDS, except that they are able to block potential threats as well. They monitor, log and report activities, similarly to an IDS, but they are also capable of stopping threats without the system administrator getting involved. If an IPS is not tuned correctly, it can also deny legitimate traffic, so they are not suitable for all applications.

##### True Positive 😁
A true positive is when an attack is expected and the attack is real...

##### False Positive 😒
A false positive, is a result that indicates a given condition exists when it does not. [Alarm Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_fatigue)

##### True Negative ✅
An attack was not suspected and nothing actually occurred. Everything is good here.

##### False Negative 😱
An attack occured and it wasn't caught, no alarms raised! the worst of the worst
