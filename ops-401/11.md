Amazon Web Services is a cloud provider that allows users to setup and configure their own private cloud networks. A VPC (virtual private cloud) is a virtual data center in the cloud. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including a selection of your own private IP address range, creation of subnets and configuration of route tables and network gateways. The benefit of VPC is that it helps in aspects of cloud computing like privacy, security and preventing loss of proprietary data.

Azure Provides a similar service but encourages users to follow one of their pre-designed blueprints. An Azure Blueprint is a package for creating specific sets of standards and requirements that govern the implementation of Azure services, security, and design. Such packages are reusable so that consistency and compliance among resources can be maintained.

A nice feature of choice for either of these platforms is the ability to create systems that are disconnected from direct external access or communication. It is common to put sensitive information, and data access behind the wall of a VPC network which has a narrow entry point to help limit and mitigate external risk factors.
