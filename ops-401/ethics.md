> "We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used," the letter reads. "As employees and shareholders we do not want to become war profiteers. To that end, we believe that Microsoft must stop in its activities to empower the U.S. Army's ability to cause harm and violence."

With great power come great responsibility, and biting the hand that feeds you is occasionally the only solution. Ethics in technology is becoming a frontrunner concern for all tech companies around the world. Science throughout history has been used to devastate nations and bring victories through gross atrocities, to prove this statement you can simply look to the infamous WWII bombings, Agent Orange or any of our modern warcraft machines. Despite the brutal effectiveness of these weapons war is now being waged on a new front and the soldiers are now drone pilots, software developers, and cyber security professionals and their services are being sold to the highest bidders often without the individuals consent or knowledge of how their product is being used. 

It is the responsibilities of each individual to not mindlessly follow orders but to always think about the ramifications of the tools and techniques being built and developed.
