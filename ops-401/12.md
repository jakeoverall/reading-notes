Traffic mirroring is useful to set up and allow a true Packet Capture to occur without modifying or needing to have a primary host monitor and log traffic. With mirroring the traffic a host recieves to some other device or series of devices we can setup independent dedicated systems for monitoring [PCAP](../10.md), [IPD/IPS](../11.md) or any other system to facilitate monitoring and analysis of network traffic and threat detection.
