Data File Encryption - CIA Triad

> The pillars of Security Standards

### The CIA *not the .gov*

- **Confidentiality**
    - Restricting access to information to approved individuals both at rest and during transit.

- **Integrity**
    - Prevent data from being tampered with and only allow data to change in a known expected way. Often it is necessary to keep track of the 5 W's when data is modified or even simply requested and viewed both of these are unique events. 

- **Availability**
    - Is exactly what it sounds like, Data must be accessible while ensuring the other two pillars are not violated. There are many schemes for data transfer and they can cause difficulties which may negatively impact the user experience if not handled well.

### CIA Transfers 🤝

- In Transit <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*31bG4pn4krTrm3emAYFAow.png" height="45"/> 
    - encryption through secure file transfer protocols like 
- At rest
    - Most databases now have data at rest encryption, but don't forget about file storage, Server files containing data should be encrypted.
- E2E
    - Public Keys vs Private Keys, Sign and send in the correct order with the correct key
- MFA
    - Passwords are terrible and should be abolished, the worlds not ready but CyberSec is.
