## AppSec
Application security encompasses measures taken to improve the security of an application often by finding, fixing and preventing security vulnerabilities. Different techniques are used to surface such security vulnerabilities at different stages of an applications lifecycle such as design, development, deployment, upgrade, maintenance.

An always evolving but largely consistent set of common security flaws seen across applications below.

|         Category         |     Threats & Attacks      |
|:------------------------:|:---------------------------|
| Input Validation         | Buffer overflow; cross-site scripting; SQL injection; canonicalization |
| Software Tampering       | Attacker modifies an existing application's runtime behavior to perform unauthorized actions; exploited via binary patching, code substitution, or code extension |
| Authentication           | Network eavesdropping; Brute force attack; dictionary attacks; cookie replay; credential theft |
| Authorization            | Elevation of privilege; disclosure of confidential data; data tampering; luring attacks |
| Configuration management | Unauthorized access to administration interfaces; unauthorized access to configuration stores; retrieval of clear text configuration data; lack of individual accountability; over-privileged process and service accounts |
| Sensitive information    | Access sensitive code or data in storage; network eavesdropping; code/data tampering |
| Session management       | Session hijacking; session replay; man in the middle |
| Cryptography             | Poor key generation or key management; weak or custom encryption |
| Parameter manipulation   | Query string manipulation; form field manipulation; cookie manipulation; HTTP header manipulation |
| Exception management     | Information disclosure; denial of service |
| Auditing and logging     | User denies performing an operation; attacker exploits an application without trace; attacker covers his or her tracks |

## Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)

[https://www.zaproxy.org](https://www.zaproxy.org)

ZAP is a free, open-source penetration testing tool being maintained under the umbrella of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). ZAP is designed specifically for testing web applications.

Zap has been designed specifically to emulate the common `man-in-the-middle` proxy attack. The `man-in-the-middle` attack as it's name sounds allows an attacker to sit and monitor the traffic between a client and a server. the client's browser and the web application rarely will identify this attack is occuring which often allows the attacker to sit quietly and glean private information without the user being aware anything is happening. The attacker also has the ability to modify the contents of messages being sent or recieved between the client and the server.

ZAP provides functionality for a range of skill levels and practice attacks that developers testers and security professionals can all find useful. Zap also has the abilty to have scripts setup for automation and alerting with vulnerability scans detect issues. 

| âš  WARNING: `Testing` applications without permission can be illegal. Please use ZAP within the bounds that you have been specifically given permission to test. |
