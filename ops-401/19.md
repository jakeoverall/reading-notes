## What is the `ELK Stack`
- **ElasticSearch**
  - An open-source, RESTful convention search and analytics engine. ElasticSearch offers a wide range of supported languages, high performance, and schema-free documents.
- **LogStash**
  - A data processing pipeline that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources, transform it on the fly, and send it to a desired location. LogStash is most often used as a data pipeline for Elasticsearch
- **Kibana**
  - A data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch. Kibana provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data
