> Data Loss Prevention is so much more than simply backing up a database. 

### Why every company needs DLP

There is almost no company in today's modern technical world that does business without collecting any data on its customers. Although signing up for a simple rewards card at your favorite cookie company may seem like an innocent enough action, chances are you as a customer and the company are transfering [`PII`](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/personally-identifiable-information-PII#:~:text=Personally%20identifiable%20information%20(PII)%20is,data%20can%20be%20considered%20PII.) or Personally Identifiable Information.

Personally identifiable information (PII) is **any** data that could potentially identify a specific individual. This wording is incredibly open for interpretation and can have lawsuits filed for its violation very easily. 

Back to the cookie business let's say the rewards program requires your name and email address or phone number. If the cookie company is not [Encrypting your data](./ops-401/06.md) and following the [CIA Triad](./ops-401/05.md) of security standards then both parties are now at risk. 

### Three Key Points

Data loss prevention solves three main objectives that are common pain points for many organizations: 

- Personal information protection 
    - DLP can identify, classify, and tag sensitive data, monitor activities and events surrounding PII, and add provide the details needed for compliance audits
- Intellectual property (IP) protection
    - Corporate Espionage is real and should be defended against. Protect your recipes that make you and your company unique and Identify if data has been accessed outside of expectations
- Data visibility
    -  Every company should know the 5 w's of their data access. Without data tracking and monitoring it is impossible to determine if compliance is being achieved
