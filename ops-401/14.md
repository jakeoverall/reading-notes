ATT&CK is one of the more comprehensive methods that can look at the actual malware components and lay them out in detail. Most modern malware uses a combination of techniques to hide its operation, stage its exploits, evade detection, and leverage network weaknesses. Finding these various building blocks is a key part of defending against their perfidy.

Att&ck is a great tool for analyzing what attack venues are or were commonly used to deploy an attack through all the stages of the [Cyber Kill-Chain](./14.md). The Attack Navigator tool has an excellent overlapping layers feature that can easily be color coded to help identify various attack types and their shared channels of execution.
