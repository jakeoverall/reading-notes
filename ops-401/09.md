Network Packet Analysis with Wireshark
-----------
_10/16/2020_

Wireshark is a free, open-source packet analyzer. It is a tool that is commonly used by both red and blue teams. Wireshark can be used for network troubleshooting, analysis and education.

Wireshark is a tool that every network or security administrator should know. It is an open‚Äêsource tool used for capturing network traffic and analyzing packets at an extremely granular level. Sometimes Wireshark is called a network analyzer or a sniffer. Packet capturing can tell you about transmit time, source, destination, and protocol type. This can be critical information for evaluating events that are happening or troubleshooting devices across your network. It can also help a security analyst determine whether network traffic is a malicious attack, what type of attack, the IP addresses that were targeted, and where the attack originated from. As a result, you will be able to create rules on a firewall to block the IP addresses where the malicious traffic originated.

Wireshark shows packet details captured from different network media, breaking down the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model into the data link, network, transport, and application layers.

### Wifi Pineapple (red)
A wifi pineapple is generally a device used to mimic or mirror an access point which can trick unexpecting people to connect to what appears as a `safe open network` Like ***McDonalds Guest***. In Reality people are connecting to a compromised network and are falling victim to the infamous `Man-in-the-Middle` attack. With an incredible tool like wireshark and a person connecting to a compromised network, the attacker can simply "sniff" the network packets and easily apply filters to find any information that is being sent over unsecured methods.
